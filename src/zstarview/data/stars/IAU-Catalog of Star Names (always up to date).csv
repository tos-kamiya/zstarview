This erroneous commentary read, in brief part: ""eirisim...ab ireo"", or, ""[the constellation name] eirisim...[coming] from [the word] ireus"". Apparently in one manuscript of the Latin Almagest, the final word of this commentary, ab ireo, were written on the next line below the constellation title, where the descriptions of the stars begin. Since the first star entered in the Almagest under the constellation Cygnus is β Cyg, the words ab ireo seem to have been confused as a name for this star.

Secondly, in Arabic, ""right forearm"" is spelled correctly as al-dhira al-yumna, which (in contrast to al-yamin) lacks assonance in the last syllable to Alderamin. Therefore, it is more likely that Alderamin is derived from the various medieval Western abbreviations of muqaddam al-dhira<ain, ""the Preceding One of the Two Cubits, or Forearms,"" which was a sci-A name (based on ind-A) for α Gem.

In Renaissance times this corruption was erroneously attributed to the assumed Arabic word ""bat"" [properly ibt], for ""the Armpit"" of al-jauza', giving rise to the corruption  Betelgeuse"" seen today. Thus by Renaissance times both the ""y"" and ""d"" of the first part of the ind-A name had become corrupted.) The ind-A asterism al-jauza' was a feminine figure represented in the stars of what is today Orion. The origin of its name is unclear (as with nearly all of the ancient group of ind-A names). The root jwz can mean ""middle,"" and the word al-jauza' is structured as a feminine adjective, thus al-jauza' may mean ""the female one, having something about her related to the middle."" There have been different speculations as to what the ""middle"" reference, if that is what it is, could be (for one example). The ind-Arabs' al-jauza' corresponded to what in other cultures was Gemini among the zodiacal signs. The sci-Arabs subsequently used the indigenous name for both the Greek Orion and Twins, leading to some confusion in star names between the two constellations. An alternative sci-A name for Orion was al-jabbar, ""the Giant"" and for Gemini, al-taw'aman, ""the Twins.""","Arabic","Kunitzsch, Paul; Smart, Tim (2006).

"Wurren","357","HR 338","5348","ζ Phe","Phe","Wurren is the Wardaman name of ζ Phe, from the Northern Territory, Australia. Wurren means “child” and refers to the “Little Fish”, a child of Dungdung – the life-creating Frog Lady. Wurren gives water to Gawalyan, the echidna (Achernar), which they direct Earthly initiates to carry in small bowls. The water came from a great waterfall used to cool the people during the ceremony. Just as the water at the base of the waterfall keeps people cool and rises to the sky as mist, the water in the initiates’ bowls keeps them cool and symbolically transforms into clouds that bring the wet rains of the monsoon season. These ceremonies occur in late December when the weather is hot and these stars are high in the evening sky, signalling the start of the monsoon.","Aboriginal/ Wardaman","Cairns, H. and Harney, B.Y.
